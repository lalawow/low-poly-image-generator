### This project is inspired by:
* Web page design: [Trianglify.io](https://trianglify.io)
* image triangulation setting: [snorpey's image triangulation demo](https://snorpey.github.io/triangulation/)
* image triangluation work-flow: [a zhihu answer about low-poly image generation](https://www.zhihu.com/question/29856775/answer/57668656) by [Ovilia@Github](https://github.com/Ovilia)

### Some packages are used: 
* [delaunator](https://github.com/mapbox/delaunator) for delaunay triangulation of points
* [sobel](https://github.com/miguelmota/sobel) for image edge detectation
